## A* Algorithm for flying objects 
(under development) 

A modified A* algorithm that introduces a FlyCost variable to produce more realistic flight behavior for flying creatures around large obstacles such as mountains or buildings. The key is that the path avoids a certain height and flies around  
The key was to reproduce the Algorithm used in Horizon Zero Dawn: https://www.guerrilla-games.com/read/putting-the-ai-back-into-air


### How Play
- Press Enter to create new paths
- use the UI to clean the paths or rotate the camera
